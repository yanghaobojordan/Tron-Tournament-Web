### Stretch Goals

- Customization
- Tournament design and scheduling
- User accounts

## Database Tables and Scheme

See DatabaseSetup.md

### Feature List Details

Our main priority is having a cohesive web application that will display a leaderboard of every studentâ€™s submission, as well as a page for every studentâ€™s game replays. This will require:

- A web page for displaying the leaderboard
- Linking pages for displaying each studentâ€™s replays
- Visualizations for every game replay

A list of what pages/screens your app will include and a brief description of the content that will go on each page/screen

- **Page 1:** Instructions (How to play the game, how to submit a script, etc..)
- **Page 2:** Display rankings of all-tournament (a list of player rankings in descending order)
- **Page 3:** Replays of matches that the tournament runs

Notes on which features will be prioritized vs. what features are secondary
Key features: View rankings of all tournament games, and view replays of matches that the tournament runs.
Secondary features: upload scripts, and tournament running and scheduling.
